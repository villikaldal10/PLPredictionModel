# PLPredictionModel
Premier League Prediction Model. Practicum II Project by Villi Kaldal

For this project, I used Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib, and a Premier League dataset that I acquired from Kaggle, to create a match predictor model that can be used to predict any Premier League match. We only need to give our model the code for what team is Home and what team is Away and it will give us a prediction based on the match results since the start of the Premier League in 1992. The Notebook can be found here above under "Main_PL_Predictor" and all that needs to be done is replace the bottom cell of code, where it currently says "ArsenalHome" and "ChelseaAway". Further instructions and detailed explanation on how to get new predictions can be found there! If you want to ask for a prediction, just make sure that your team name is written the same as it is written in the list of 'teams' list at the top of the code.

As well as I uploaded the "Main_PL_Predictor", I will upload the notebooks that I failed with, because I would have never been able to finish the project without these mistakes. The only thing I regret is trying to fix them and making them look better, because believe it or not they looked even worse before. They can be found above with appropriate names.

For more detailed information regarding my project please watch this video I made about the whole process: https://youtu.be/tc7ydd2bghs

The dataset I mention in my video with more features included can also be found as "more_features_results"

Thank you!
