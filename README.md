# PLPredictionModel
Premier League Prediction Model. Practicum II Project by Villi Kaldal

For this project, I used Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib, and a Premier League dataset that I acquired from Kaggle, to create a match predictor model that can be used to predict any Premier League match. We only need to give our model the code for what team is Home and what team is Away and it will give us a prediction based on the match results since the start of the Premier League in 1992. The Notebook can be found here above under "Main_PL_Predictor" and all that needs to be done is replace the bottom cell of code, where it currently says "ArsenalHome" and "ChelseaAway". Further instructions and detailed explanation on how to get new predictions can be found there! If you want to ask for a prediction, just make sure that your team name is written the same as it is written in the list of 'teams' list at the top of the code.
